make some way of transmuting the pletlang escape sequences into PletlangEscapeSequence objects...
then from there, I can transmute the PletlangEscapeSequences into PletASMCommands
then I can write them. sounds easy enough...?

.plet -(PletlangReader)-> PletlangString -> PletlangCommandGrouper -(PletASMTranslator)-> -(PletASMWriter)-> .pletasm
