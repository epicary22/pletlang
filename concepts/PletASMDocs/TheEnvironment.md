# The PletASM Environment

## What does the Environment do?

To store global values in PletASM, you must make a call to change a value in the Environment. You can then query the Environment for values when needed.

## Why do we need it?

The Environment stores all value that control how PletASM is interpreted.  
For instance, it has a value for the current color of speech which is queried every time an `out` function is called.
