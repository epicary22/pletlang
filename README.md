# Pletlang Mk. 2

## What is this?

Pletlang is my (epicary22's) own communication protocol for <a href="https://runesfurryblog.wordpress.com/2017/04/11/protogens-are-the-new-craze/">protogens</a>. I've had a couple previous versions, but I've never been quite happy with them; I'm finally happy with this one!

## They use... binary?
Of course! They're silly cyborg creatures, so they need a standard on-and-off signal method of communication. This allows them to communicate with anything -- think of semaphore, but with only 2 positions; or barcodes with black and white stripes. The original intent for this writing system was to only have 16 different characters, each of which were made of 4 bits (also known as a nybble).

## Wait, so they speak too?
Yeah! Their speech is intended to sound like an electric hum, using only <a href="https://learningattheprimarypond.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-voiced-and-unvoiced-sounds-how-do-you-teach-this-in-your-classroom/">voiced</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fricative">fricative</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximant">approximant</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel">vowel</a> phonemes. This was a joke on how protogens are often called "Toasters"; you'd figure if a toaster could speak, it would be something like this.

## That's cool and all, but why is this such a big deal to you?
I've enjoyed phonology for a long time, and I really like to mess around with low-level things like ANSI escape codes and shell scripting. This project really lets me use both of those to my creativity's extent; it's something I have right now where I can just come up with an idea and implement it right away. And, of course, I want to make the Toasters sound funny.

## Well... where do I start now?
You can head over to `concepts/PletlangDocs/README.md` to learn more! Best of luck on your Plet journey!

## Protogen Rant
I don't like the concept of "illegal protogens". If I want to make a creature like <a href="https://d.furaffinity.net/art/zenithsouterreach/1650200036/1650200036.zenithsouterreach_protogen_rare_traits.jpg">this</a>, what's stopping me? Apparently a hefty price tag. And if I don't pay, I'll get "blacklisted by the creator".  
There's something to be said here about limitation of creative expression. The species itself is free-to-use, but accessorizing it costs big bucks. This makes me wonder: is my design for <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/959850110810992670/1191043162412695634/IMG_1359.jpg?ex=65a40062&is=65918b62&hm=d3b5c7c9b1e33e737e74ffdf77df360b56c2f30e75be794f81f132484e21d034&">Plet</a> (seen here swimming in radioactive waste) considered "illegal" because of its music note cheek plates? It just stresses me out, and I wish that I could freely make a fursuit of Plet without a fear of getting "blacklisted".
